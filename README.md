## Demos

### Demo1 - Create Azure API Management 

In this first demo I'll be creating an instance of Azure API Management which will act as a gateway for your API and provides many features which will be explored in the following demos.

### Demo2 - Import your API

Now that we have our API gateway setup, let's import an API.

### Demo3 - Testing and Mocking

In this demo I'll show you how to test your API endpoints as well as create new endpoints with a mocked response.

### Demo4 - Policies 

In this demo I'll show you one of the key features of API Management which is Policies. With policies we can set quotas, rate limiting, transformation and many more. 

### Demo5 - Versions and Revisions 

In this demo I'll show you how to create revisions of your API for non-breaking changes and then when there is a breaking change how to create a new version.
