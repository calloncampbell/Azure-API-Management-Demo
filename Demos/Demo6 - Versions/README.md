# Demo6 - Versions and Revisions

With API versions and revisions there is no one true way.






Revisions - Providers choose when to deploy
Versions - Consumers choose when to adopt



When you create/import an API you have the option to define a version. If you choose not to version you will be able to add/define versioning at a later time.
